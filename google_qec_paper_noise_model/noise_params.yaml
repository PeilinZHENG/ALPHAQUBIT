# Noise parameters for a circuit-level depolarizing model, aligned with
# the model described in "Efficient and Universal Neural-Network Decoder
# for Stabilizer-Based Quantum Error Correction" (arXiv:2502.19971v2).
#
# This model uses a simplified set of parameters for depolarizing noise
# at different stages of the quantum circuit.
version: 1.0

# This processor configuration reflects a uniform depolarizing noise model
# where the error probabilities are consistent across different operations.
# The value p=0.005 is used as a canonical example in the paper.
processors:
  uniform_depolarizing:
    p_idle: 0.005  # Probability of idle depolarizing error per round
    p_gate: 0.005  # Probability of gate depolarizing error
    p_reset: 0.005 # Probability of reset error (X flip)
    p_meas: 0.005  # Probability of measurement error (X flip before measurement)
